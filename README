// Installation / Getting Started //////////////////////////////////////////////

Instructions for installing the OCCAM toolchain and building a bitcode 
version of the FreeBSD base distribution. The following instructions 
have been tested with FreeBSD 10.0 amd64.

-- Prerequisites: --------------------------------------------------------------

1. FreeBSD

The ideal way to start is with a clean install of FreeBSD 10.0 with 
sources installed. The simplest way to do this is to install from the 
Release 10.0 ISO image and and on the "Distribution Select" screen 
select just the following:

  [*] ports   Ports tree
  [*] src     System source code

If you are on an existing system that has either an old version of the 
source tree or is missing source, you can follow the instructions in the 
FreeBSD Handbook Chapter 24 to get the relevant sources.

2. Necessary ports

Upgrade the ports collection (as 'root'):

   su -
   portsnap fetch
   portsnap extract
   cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade
   make -DBATCH install clean
   portupgrade -a --batch

Install the following ports using the BSD port tree: 

  bash git subversion python27 protobuf py-protobuf sudo wget

(See the FreeBSD Handbook Chapter 5 for instructions.)
The quick way to do this is:

   su -
   cd /usr/ports
   cd shells/bash && make -DBATCH install clean && \
     cd ../../devel/git && make -DBATCH install clean && \
     cd ../../devel/subversion && make -DBATCH install clean && \
     cd ../../devel/protobuf && make -DBATCH install clean && \
     cd ../../devel/py-protobuf && make -DBATCH install clean && \
     cd ../../security/sudo && make -DBATCH install clean && \
     cd ../../ftp/wget && make -DBATCH install clean

(Python27 is installed as a prerequisite of Subversion.)

You will need to do the following to make Python work:

   su -
   cd /usr/local/bin
   ln -s python2 python

Below we assume the shell being used is bash, that is:

   chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

has been run. If you want to use another shell, replace bash-isms like 
'export' with the appropriate equivalent.

We suggest installing 'sudo' and setting up your account as a sudoer, to 
make installing programs easier. You can do this, or modify the commands 
that use 'sudo' below.

3. LLVM and Clang 3.5

Install LLVM and Clang version 3.5. (These instructions adapted from 
http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) Decide where you want to 
install LLVM. If you have 'root' access, you can use the default 
'/usr/local', though any location is fine. You may then wish to add this 
to your shell startup (in '~/.profile' for bash):

  export LLVM_HOME=/usr/local

Get LLVM and Clang version 3.5:

  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_35 llvm
  cd llvm/tools
  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/branches/release_35 clang
  cd ../projects
  svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/branches/release_35 compiler-rt
  cd ../..

Now finish the build and install:

  cd llvm
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure --prefix=$LLVM_HOME --enable-assertions \
      --enable-targets=host-only --enable-optimized
  gmake -j8
  sudo gmake install

Note that the FreeBSD 10.0 base includes Clang 3.3 (but does not include 
the complete LLVM framework).

4. Checkout the 'llvm3.5-on-freebsd10' branch of the code:

   git clone https://github.com/SRI-CSL/OCCAM.git
   export OCCAM_SRC=`pwd`/OCCAM

-- Installing OCCAM ------------------------------------------------------------

With the prerequisites satisfied, we can install OCCAM. Decide where you 
want to install the tool. Below we assume it will be in your home 
directory. We recommend adding the below exports to your shell startup. 

  export CC=clang
  export CXX=clang++
  export CPP='clang -E'
  export OCCAM_HOME=~/occam

Also, adjust the shell PATH so the LLVM tools built in step 3 above 
(that are in $LLVM_HOME/bin) will be picked up ahead of the system ones 
(typically in /usr/bin).

  export PATH=${LLVM_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
  cd $OCCAM_SRC

Edit the Makefile and uncomment the lines exporting LLVM_HOME and 
OCCAM_HOME at the top of the file (if they are not set in your 
environment). Change the paths to your choices. Now build and install 
the tool.

  gmake
  gmake install		(Note: 'sudo' is used for non-root Python setup)

If you make modifications to the Python scripts and want to install the
new ones without rebuilding the C++ library, use "gmake install-occam".

Create an alias to the 'occam' toolchain wrapper. For bash, add the 
following to to your shell startup:

  alias occam=$OCCAM_HOME/bin/occam

-- Mount the /proc filesystem --------------------------------------------------

Part of the parallel build driver in the toolchain reads from the /proc 
filesystem. This isn't mounted by default on FreeBSD. We'll need to 
mount it before using the tool. You can mount it with the following command:

  sudo mount -t procfs proc /proc

Alternatively, you can add this filesystem to '/etc/fstab':

proc            /proc           procfs  rw      0       0

-- buildworld ------------------------------------------------------------------

To build a lot of useful libraries and executables in a hurry, we'll 
first run the FreeBSD 'buildworld' process using the OCCAM toolchain. 
For details of the 'buildworld' process, see Chapter 24.6 of the FreeBSD 
Handbook.

First, we need to patch one of the 'buildworld' make files to prevent it 
from removing the OCCAM toolchain from the path after it compiles fresh 
versions of Clang and the rest of the FreeBSD toolchain. We'll also need 
to tell 'make' to use Clang (which our toolchain will masquerade as) by 
changing '/etc/src.conf'. While we're at it, we'll turn off some parts 
of the build to reduce how much time it takes.

  cd /usr/src
  sudo patch -p1 < $OCCAM_SRC/patches/Makefile.inc1-occam.patch
  sudo cp $OCCAM_SRC/patches/src.conf /etc/src.conf

Before starting the build, you can choose to record logs from the OCCAM 
tool by setting the following variables:

  export OCCAM_LOGFILE={absolute path to log location}
  export OCCAM_LOGLEVEL={INFO, WARNING, or ERROR}

Now kick off the build. You will want to use -jN for some N, as this 
process takes a long time without the OCCAM toolchain, and even longer 
with (i.e. hours).

  mkdir $OBJ_DIR {wherever you want to build everything}
  MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$OBJ_DIR ; export MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX
  occam make buildworld

This should go smoothly, but occasionally IOErrors related to reading 
the /proc file system may occur. It should be safe to continue the build 
in this case:

  occam make -DNO_CLEAN buildworld

At this point, you have a few options. We have tested option 1 below,
but the others should also work.

Option 1) Actually install your new "world"

  To be really safe, we'll build a new kernel with this source as well. You
  *may* be able to skip this step, along with 'mergemaster', but we haven't
  tried that. For more information, use 'man mergemaster'. The "-iU" options
  try  to make this process as automatic as possible.
  
  !!! You'll need non-ssh access to the box for this.

  If you don't want to rebuild the kernel, only perform the third step 
  of the below five:

     cd /usr/src
     make buildkernel
     sudo shutdown now              (drops into single user mode)
     make installkernel                            (don't use -j)
     mergemaster -p

  Switching to single user mode results in a new shell, where environment
  variables and aliases must be set again:

     export OCCAM_HOME=~/occam
     export OCCAM_LOGFILE=/tmp/occam.log
     export OCCAM_LOGLEVEL=INFO
     export MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$OBJ_DIR
     alias occam=$OCCAM_HOME/bin/occam

  The new world can now be installed:

     cd /usr/src
     occam make installworld                       (don't use -j)
     mergemaster -iU
     shutdown -r now

  When the machine comes back up, you should have a full FreeBSD system with bitcode
  versions of all of the core libraries and executables.

Option 2) Install your new "world" somewhere else, chroot into it, and set up a
development environment.

  Choose somewhere to install everything to $WORLD_DIR.
    
     occam make installworld DESTDIR=$WORLD_DIR
  
  !Note, you cannot (according to the Handbook) use -j when using installworld.
  chroot into $WORLD_DIR and reinstall LLVM, Clang, and OCCAM.

Option 3) Extract all the libraries and store them somewhere else.

  Choose a folder to store all of your libraries, $LIB_DIR. Extract all the
  libraries you built into it.
  
     find /usr/obj/usr/src/lib -name "*.bc.a" -exec cp {} $LIB_DIR \;
  
  You can also extract manifests, partially built applications
  (pre-library linking), bitcode-compiled applications, and native applications
  compiled from the bitcode versions. The manifests may contain absolute paths
  to libraries that may need changing, however.

     find /usr/obj/usr/src/usr.* -name "*.manifest" -exec cp {} $DEST \;
     find /usr/obj/usr/src/usr.* -name "*_main.bc" -exec cp {} $DEST \;
     find /usr/obj/usr/src/usr.* -name "*.bc" -exec cp {} $DEST \;

  When trying to use the OCCAM toolchain with these libraries, you'll need to
  add $LIB_DIR to $OCCAM_LIB_PATH (described further below). When specializing
  or using "occam2 build" with a manifest, you'll need to add $LIB_DIR to the
  "search" entry in the manifest.

// Building applications and libraries /////////////////////////////////////////

Once you have your base system installed and ready to go, you should be ready to
compile and install other libraries or applications.

First, set the following environmental variables. (You may want to set these in

   CC=clang
   CXX=clang++
   CPP='clang -E'

You should now be able to compile most well-behaved projects with:

   occam ./configure <options>
   occam make
   occam make install

Occam has a few configuration options, set via environmental variables.

   OCCAM_LOGFILE        Absolute path of file to log to
   OCCAM_LOGLEVEL       Logging detail, may be one of INFO, WARNING, or ERROR
   OCCAM_LIB_PATH       Additional directories to include in the search path for 
   			finding bitcode versions of libraries. Not necessary if
			libraries are installed next to their native versions
			(e.g., /path/to/libs:/morelibs)
   OCCAM_PROTECT_PATH	Set/unset flag. If set, OCCAM will remove all non-OCCAM
   			items from the path and intercept calls to common 
			executables so that they can be logged at level INFO.
			Can be useful for debugging a build that isn't working
			properly.


// WLLVM installation ///////////////////
Occam leverages WLLVM bitcode generation for building bitcode equivalents for libraries
and executables. Install WLLVM:

git clone https://github.com/SRI-CSL/whole-program-llvm.git

Make sure the WLLVM tools are added to the PATH variable

/// ------------------------- ////////   

To compile as much code as possible to bitcode, you should choose any available
configure options for building or using static libraries rather than shared ones.

-- Special notes for Apache ----------------------------------------------------

For apache, you'll first need to compile and install libpcre, libapr, and 
libapr-util. The configurations I used for each of these are:

  libpcre: built from pcre-8.31.tar.gz
     occam ./configure --enable-shared=no

  libapr: built from apr-1.4.6.tar.gz
     occam ./configure --enable-shared=no

  libapr-util:
     occam ./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apr --disable-util-dso --with-crypto

You may be able to drop --with-crypto, which could fix the configure issue for
apache that I describe below. For apache, I used the following configure:

    occam ./configure --prefix=$SOMEPREFIX --enable-modules=none   \
    	  --enable-mods-static=most --enable-static-support        \
	  --with-apr=/usr/local/apr --with-apr-util=/usr/local/apr \
	  --with-pcre=/usr/local

You then need to patch build/config_vars.mk because something in the configure
script seems to be detecting crypto options wrong. I'll debug this, but the
workaround for now is to fix the following variables:

   CRYPT_LIBS = -lcrypt
   SSL_LIBS = -lssl -lcrypto -lcrypt -lpthread

To run apache using command line options (to make it easy to previrtualize),
you'll need to set up a basic ServerRoot directory somewhere with the following
configuration.

   $SERVERROOT
   |- conf
      |- mime.types       (an empty text file)
   |- logs		  (an empty directory)
   |- www
      |- index.html	  (something to serve...)
   |- httpd.conf	  (an empty text file)

The following set of arguments should then work to get apache serving files:

   -d $SERVERROOT
   -f httpd.conf
   -C 'Listen 8181'
   -C 'LogLevel debug'
   -C 'User apache' -C 'Group apache'
   -C 'ServerName localhost'
   -C 'ErrorLog /home/moore/root/error_log'
   -C 'DocumentRoot /home/moore/root/www' 
   -C 'AddType text/plain .html' 
   -k start

// Using manifest files ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Once you have a manifest file and a bundle, you can use it to build a final
bitcode version of an application or specialize it. To build from the
manifest, just execute:

   occam build $MANIFEST_FILE $NAME_FOR_EXECUTABLE

To specialize the application, add a "args": ["arg1", "arg2", ...] entry to
the manifest file and call the previrt tool:

   occam previrt --work-dir=$WORKDIR $MANIFEST_FILE

As before, you can set OCCAM configuration variables to control logging.

// TODO items //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-- General -------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Dead code elimination on all of the repositories to clean up unused passes,
    targets, #ifdef 0-ed regions, etc, etc, etc

-- Toolchain -------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Save object files off when bundling. The bundling process uses llvm-ld which
    does not link ELF files into the resulting bitcode. We should save off the
    necessary ELF object files from the inputs or library to link in later at
    build or previrtualization time. (This causes the manifest build for at
    least clang during the buildworld process, and probably others)
[ ] Link in said object bundles during occam-build or occam-previrt

-- Previrt -------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Debug previrtualized version of httpd. The previrtualized version of httpd
    does not start correctly. It seems likely this is due to interactions with
    pthreads (possibly some incorrectly eliminated symbols?).
[ ] Figure out how to avoid needing to relink in libc, etc. to get the symbols
    we need for the C runtime. (and C++/pthreads?)
[ ] Add support for better call-graphs. Either improve Gregory's call graph,
    choose a better one that's already in llvm, or port over the DSA call-graph
    stuff in poolalloc.
[ ] Support for previrtualizing un-named functions
[ ] Support for previrtualizing internal function pointers accross module 
    boundaries for call backs.
[ ] To avoid creating multiple clones of the same specialized function, we check
    if it already exists by looking it up in the module by name. This check
    should probably be more robust. This is related to support for un-named
    functions because we need to make sure we're using unique specializations
    for the different functions.
[ ] For ease of understanding, give created globals for strings, etc., names so
    they don't show up as unnamed in the symbol table.
[ ] Extract statistics about the previrtualization process.
